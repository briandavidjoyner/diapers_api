After seeing our friends (and family members) get married and start having kids of their own, we noticed just how much it costs to raise a kid!<br><br>Over the 2016 winter break we put our heads together and started thinking about ways we could help these new parents save money on basic baby costs like diapers.  We noticed the average baby uses a ton of diapers.  We also noticed nearly every diaper we saw was a Pampers, Huggies, or Luvs brand diaper.<br><br>The last parts of the equation came together when we noticed a lot of our friends were buying diapers from Amazon and Walmart.  A few weeks later we developed our first prototype and the rest is history!</div></h3>
